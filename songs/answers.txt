If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I would probably divide moods in three categories: Happy, Chill, Sad and based on two most prominent features determine which mood is best.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of
calculating this aura would you propose?
The current calculation may oversimplify the listener's preferences by averaging diverse songs without considering play count and context,
so a better approach would involve weighted averages based on time spent listening to some particulare song and analyzing listening patterns like time during day
in which songs were played.
